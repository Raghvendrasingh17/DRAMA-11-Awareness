About Drama11
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drama11 was born out of a desire to expose the darker side of betting apps, and to educate users about the risks associated with them.

With Drama11, I aim to highlight the harmful effects of blindly trusting these apps and encourage users to think twice before engaging in such activities. Through a combination of design elements, parody content, and informative sections, Drama11 seeks to provoke thought and encourage critical thinking among users.
